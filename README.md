- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ReniGG
- ğŸš€ I'm new to coding. Right now, I'm focusing on the basics and taking things one step at a time.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working through the basics of Python.
- ğŸ“– My goal is to build a solid foundation and try out some small projects as I go.
- ğŸ’¡ Iâ€™m interested in eventually building my skills in backend development, cloud engineering, server-side work, APIs, databases.
